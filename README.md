The examples rely on the [SDL library](http://libsdl.org).

To build an SDL program in the labs (JB-358 and JB 359),
put your source code into a folder and run the following 
inside that folder:

~~~
c++ `sdl2-config --cflags --libs` *.cpp
~~~

The above command also should work in an OS X and Linux environment.
